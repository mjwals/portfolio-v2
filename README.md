# Portfolio (Vue)
In 2026, I set out to sharpen my development skills by redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio based on feedback from prospective employers. The new version introduces clearer separation between code and design work, allowing visitors to filter projects by discipline. In the code section, each project now includes a live demo and direct access to the GitHub source, making it easier for people to explore how everything works under the hood.
